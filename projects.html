<a class="another" href="https://fun.ajh499.repl.co/">Ajh Fun</a> is my most memorable website, with over 130 runs and 7 forks, this is a game website I made for my school. It originally started on Google Sites, then I learned HTML, CSS, and remade it here on Replit. Since then, I have consistently updated the website, added games nearly every single day. Besides games, I also have other random sites that are fun and not blocked. So in short, this website has random games and websites that are not flagged by my school, and I add them to my website, so other kids can play. Basically like a bookmarks bar to the public.<br>
I made this with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
<br>
<a class="another" href="https://maz2.ajh499.repl.co/">maz2</a> is a website I made for well, my girlfriend (in the context of my friend that is a girl ;-;)'s website.<br>
Two main things about this website is<br>
1. This is my first website that is specifically coded to be mobile friendly.<br>
2. This is my first project that has images floating around.<br>
(also, this is currently the project with the most CSS code I've ever had. And I mean I have a LOT.)<br>
I made this with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
<br>
<a class="another" href="https://chemistryquiz.ajh499.repl.co/">ChemistryQuiz</a> is a portal of proxies I made for my classmates and friends. I made it a website where I put forks of Ultraviolet (a very popular proxy) in the website, with lots of different names, like "books" and "khanacademy", and so on.<br>
I made this with Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>
<br>
<a class="another" href="https://randomfacts.ajh499.repl.co/">Random Facts</a> is well... a website I made that gives random facts, that are all 100% true. You click the button to get a random fact in return.<br>
I made this with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
<br>
<a class="another" href="https://dateandtime.ajh499.repl.co/">DateAndTime</a> is a website that shows, well, the date and time. I used embeds to make this to show that you don't need to learn an insane amount of JavaScript and a ton of other things to do that.<br>
The only con of the website is that it's only in the EST timezone. I made the website in literally 15 minutes at school so yeah.<br>
I made this with HTML, and CSS.<br>
