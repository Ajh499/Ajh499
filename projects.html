<a class="another" href="https://fun.ajh499.repl.co/">Ajh Fun</a> is my most memorable website, with over 120 runs and 7 forks, this is a game website I made for my school. It originally started on Google Sites, then I learned HTML, CSS, and remade it here on Replit. Since then, I have consistently updated the website, added games nearly every single day. Besides games, I also have other random sites that are fun and not blocked.
